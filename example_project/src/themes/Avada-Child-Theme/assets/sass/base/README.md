# Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In here, you might find typographic rules, a reset and most likely a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

* *Typography* The abstracts/fonts file imports fonts while the base/typography file sets base rules for typography ie. site standard font sizes, colors, etc.
