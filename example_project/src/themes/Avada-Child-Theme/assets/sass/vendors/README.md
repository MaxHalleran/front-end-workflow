# Vendors

Most projects will have a `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks - Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, etc. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say, "Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility".

This folder should be empty in this project.
